# Vending-Machine
The goal of the project is to design two Vending Machine components using the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) 
and then implement these Vending Machine components based on this design using the OO programming language. 
This OO-oriented design should be based on the MDA-EFSM for both Vending Machine components of the project. 

Design uses the following OO design patterns: 
 state pattern 
 strategy pattern 
 abstract factory pattern
